# How to configure for your resolution

[Config.ini](Config.ini) = XY Continue Button position

[Agent List.txt](Agent%20List.txt) = X Agents position

You can add agents or correct the position of existing ones after an update or for a different resolution.
Simply take a screenshot of the agent selection screen and use pretty much any image editor to acquire a certain icon's coordinates.
