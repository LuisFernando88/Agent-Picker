# How to configure for your resolution

[Continue Button.ini](Continue%20Button.ini) = XY Continue Button position

[[X]Agent List.txt]([X]Agent%20List.txt) = X Agents position

[[Y]Agent List.txt]([Y]Agent%20List.txt) = Y Agents position

You can add agents or correct the position of existing ones after an update or for a different resolution.
Simply take a screenshot of the agent selection screen and use pretty much any image editor to acquire a certain icon's coordinates.

Or use [the online method](https://github.com/pintoso/Agent-Picker/issues/2) (very easy)
